Directions for Running the MUD-URI DCHCP Client with our IDS system.

1. Connect your laptop to the ASUS network.
2. Record your mac address, IP, and wirless interface
3. Start the learner script
4. Run the mini_dhcp_client with your recorded mac, ip, and interface. mac should be in xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx format
       python mini_dhcp_client.py <mac> <IP> <interface>

Notes: If the ack does not show up, try multiple times. After the process is complete, only amazon.com should be reachable.
